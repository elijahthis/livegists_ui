				JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based
				on JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g.,
				sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa).
				You'll come across it quite often, so in this article we give you all you need to work with JSON using
				JavaScript, including parsing JSON so you can access data within it, and creating JSON.

				JSON is a text-based data format following JavaScript object syntax, which was popularized by Douglas
				Crockford. Even though it closely resembles JavaScript object literal syntax, it can be used
				independently from JavaScript, and many programming environments feature the ability to read (parse) and
				generate JSON.
				JSON exists as a string â€” useful when you want to transmit data across a network. It needs to be
				converted to a native JavaScript object when you want to access the data. This is not a big issue â€”
				JavaScript provides a global JSON object that has methods available for converting between the two.
				A JSON string can be stored in its own file, which is basically just a text file with an extension of
				.json, and a MIME type of application/json.
