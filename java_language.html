                Java is one of the world's most widely used computer language. Java is a simple, general-purpose,
                object-oriented, interpreted, robust, secure, architecture-neutral, portable, high-performance,
                multithreaded computer language. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere"
                (WORA), meaning that code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another.
            </p>

                Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. Java
                is a programming language built for the age of the Internet. There are lots of applications and websites
                that will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day. Java is fast, secure,
                and reliable. From laptops to datacenters, game consoles to scientific supercomputers, cell phones to
                the Internet, Java is everywhere!

                Java solves a host of problems software developers encounter, and very easily too!

            <ul>
                <li>Your Java programming language is object oriented, yet it's still dead simple. </li>
                <li>Your development cycle is much faster because Java technology is interpreted. The
                    compile-link-load-test-crash-debug cycle is obsolete--now you just compile and run.</li>
                <li>Your applications are portable across multiple platforms. Write your applications once, and you
                    never
                    need to port them--they will run without modification on multiple operating systems and hardware
                    architectures.</li>
                <li>Your applications are robust because the Java runtime environment manages memory for you.</li>
                <li>Your interactive graphical applications have high performance because multiple concurrent threads of
                    activity in your application are supported by the multithreading built into the Java programming
                    language and runtime platform.</li>
                <li>Your applications are adaptable to changing environments because you can dynamically download code
                    modules from anywhere on the network.</li>
                <li>Your end users can trust that your applications are secure, even though they're downloading code
                    from
                    all over the Internet; the Java runtime environment has built-in protection against viruses and
                    tampering.</li>
            </ul>
