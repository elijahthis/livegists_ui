                HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used language to write Web
                Pages.<br />
                Hypertext refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked together. Thus, the link
                available on a webpage is called Hypertext.<br />
                As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up" a text
                document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display.
            <p>
                Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like headings,
                paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between
                researchers.<br />
                Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags available in HTML
                language.

                HTML It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
                such as JavaScript.
                HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior
                and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web
                Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has
                encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.

            <p>
                HTML5 is the latest specification of the HTML language, and represented a major break with previous
                markup practices. The purpose of the profound changes to the language was to standardize the many new
                ways in which developers were using it, as well as to encourage a single set of best practices with
                regards to web development.
