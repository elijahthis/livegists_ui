                Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its
                high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very
                attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to
                connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and
                therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which
                encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library
                are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely
                distributed.

                Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
                structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. Python is often
                described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
