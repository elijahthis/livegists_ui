                Dart is a client-optimized language for developing fast apps on any platform. Its goal is to offer the
                most productive programming language for multi-platform development, paired with a flexible execution
                runtime platform for app frameworks.

                Languages are defined by their technical envelope â€” the choices made during development that shape the
                capabilities and strengths of a language. Dart is designed for a technical envelope that is particularly
                suited to client development, prioritizing both development (sub-second stateful hot reload) and
                high-quality production experiences across a wide variety of compilation targets (web, mobile, and
                desktop).

                The Flutter framework is a popular, multi-platform UI toolkit thatâ€™s powered by the Dart platform, and
                that provides tooling and UI libraries to build UI experiences that run on iOS, Android, macOS, Windows,
                Linux, and the web.
