                JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive
                (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced
                server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a
                website than downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a
                host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
                environment to provide programmatic control over them.

                JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
                for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:

                <p>
                <b>Client-side JavaScript</b> extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements
                on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.<br />
                <b>Server-side JavaScript</b> extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on
                a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
                provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file
                manipulations on a server.
