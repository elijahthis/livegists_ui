                JSX is an XML/HTML-like syntax used by React that extends ECMAScript so that XML/HTML-like text can
                co-exist with JavaScript/React code. The syntax is intended to be used by preprocessors (i.e.,
                transpilers like Babel) to transform HTML-like text found in JavaScript files into standard JavaScript
                objects that a JavaScript engine will parse.
            <p>
                Basically, by using JSX you can write concise HTML/XML-like structures (e.g., DOM like tree structures)
                in the same file as you write JavaScript code, then Babel will transform these expressions into actual
                JavaScript code. Unlike the past, instead of putting JavaScript into HTML, JSX allows us to put HTML
                into JavaScript.

                JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should
                look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of
                JavaScript.<br />
                JSX produces React ‚Äúelements‚Äù.
            </p>
            <p>
                React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are
                handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.<br />

                Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React
                separates concerns with loosely coupled units called ‚Äúcomponents‚Äù that contain both. We will come back
                to components in a further section, but if you‚Äôre not yet comfortable putting markup in JS, this talk
                might convince you otherwise. <br />

                React doesn‚Äôt require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI
                inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.
